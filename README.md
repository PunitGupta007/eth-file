README.md Token Coin This is a solidity program in which I am creating a token coin program. This program will take the input from the user and then give the total supply and the remaining balance as the output. The syntax used in this code is simple solidity syntax and uses the basic concept of the solidity program such as if-else condition, function creation, etc.

Description This is the simple code that uses solidity programming. Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum network, this program is a straightforward contract. The program contains two functions and some variables containing two string types, one of the uint type and the last is the mapping variable. The mapping variable is mapped from the address to the uint type. And about the functions: One is the mint function which incremented the balances and the other one is the burn function which is the opposite of the mint but the burn function also contains the if condition.

Getting Start To get started with this programming type, you should first open up the solidity compiler that is Remix online IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/. Now, when the IDE opens you first have to create a file in which you can write the code, so first click on the new file which is given at the left-hand sidebar. Name the file of your wish and save the file with an extension .sol. For example, firstcode.sol. Now, write the given code in your file

//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.18;
NEW
contract Token {

// public variables here
string public tokenName = "21BCG1005";
string public tokenSymbol = "PUNIT";
uint public totalSupply = 0;

// mapping variable here
mapping(address => uint) public balances;

// mint function
function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
    totalSupply += _amount;
    balances[_address] += _amount;
}

// burn function
function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[_address] >= _amount, "Cannot burn more than balance tokens");
    totalSupply -= _amount;
    balances[_address] -= _amount;
}
}
EXPLANATION
The smart contract is released under the MIT license, as indicated by the //SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT comment.
The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.18.
The contract is named "Token" and represents a basic token implementation.
Public Variables:
tokenName: A public string variable representing the name of the token, set to "21BCG1005".
tokenSymbol: A public string variable representing the symbol of the token, set to "PUNIT".
totalSupply: A public unsigned integer variable representing the total supply of the token, initialized to 0.
Mapping Variable:
balances: A public mapping that associates Ethereum addresses (type address) with their corresponding token balances (type uint). This mapping is used to keep track of the token balance of each address.
Mint Function:
mintTokens: A public function that allows the contract owner (or anyone with access to this function) to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
Parameters: _address is the address to which the newly minted tokens will be assigned, and _amount is the number of tokens to be minted.
The totalSupply is increased by the _amount, and the balance of _address is increased by _amount.
Burn Function:
burnTokens: A public function that allows the contract owner (or anyone with access to this function) to burn (destroy) tokens from a specified address.
Parameters: _address is the address from which the tokens will be burned, and _amount is the number of tokens to be burned.
The function checks if the balance of _address is greater than or equal to _amount using a require statement. If not, it reverts the transaction with an error message.
If the balance check passes, the totalSupply is decreased by _amount, and the balance of _address is reduced by _amount.
